# Goblin Dating Simulation: GOBSMACKED

---

## Introduction

The Goblin Dating Simulation is a web-based game that allows players to engage in a dating adventure with goblin characters. Explore a fantasy world where you can meet prospectiv goblin boys, go on dates, and see how your interactions with the goblins influence the outcome of your dates. This game combines interactive storytelling with light-hearted humor and fantasy elements.

When the browser is open and you will find yourself on the homepage, titled 'GOBSMACKED'. You can see the row of goblin options below and a button that takes you to a login page where you can login or create your account.

You must enter a valid username, email, and password to create your account. Once that is complete, the browser will take you to your profile where you can see your personal information, how many successful dates you have logged with each goblin, and your personality traits. Click on 'Edit Profile' to add additional personality traits.

Now, you can explore the menu on the top left! Here you can route back home, see what tips and tricks are recommended to get more dates, peruse the goblin boys, or go on a date.

GOBLIN BOYS: This link will take you to a page where you can see the images and names of each goblin. If you click on a goblin, additional details will show.

GO ON A DATE: This link is how we begin our dates! First, decide who you'd like to go on a date with. Once you've settled, click 'Pick Me'. Follow the prompts on each page to formulate your unique dating story with your goblin! You'll have a plethora of choices to make, all based on the personality traits you marked in your profile. When you have made it to the end of your date, click 'End Date', and you'll be returned to your profile where you can see your successfull date has been updated.

## Where Do I Start?

## Setup

### `server/`

The `server/` directory contains all of your backend code.

`app.py` is your Flask application. You'll want to use Flask to build a simple
API backend like we have in previous modules. You should use Flask-RESTful for
your routes. You should be familiar with `models.py` and `seed.py` by now, but
remember that you will need to use Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and
SQLAlchemy-Serializer instead of SQLAlchemy and Alembic in your models.

The project contains a default `Pipfile` with some basic dependencies. You may
adapt the `Pipfile` if there are additional dependencies you want to add for
your project.

To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

Check that your server serves the default route `http://localhost:5555`. You
should see a web page with the heading "Phase 4 Project Server".

### `client/`

The `client/` directory contains all of your frontend code. The file
`package.json` has been configured with common React application dependencies,
include `react-router-dom`. The file also sets the `proxy` field to forward
requests to `"http://localhost:5555". Feel free to change this to another port-
just remember to configure your Flask app to use another port as well!

To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```console
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

Check that your the React client displays a default page
`http://localhost:3000`. You should see a web page with the heading "Phase 4
Project Client".

## Generating Your Database

NOTE: The initial project directory structure does not contain the `instance` or
`migrations` folders. Change into the `server` directory:

```console
cd server
```

Then enter the commands to create the `instance` and `migrations` folders and
the database `app.db` file:

```
flask db init
flask db upgrade head
```

Remember to regularly run
`flask db revision --autogenerate -m'<descriptive message>'`, replacing
`<descriptive message>` with an appropriate message, and `flask db upgrade head`
to track your modifications to the database and create checkpoints in case you
ever need to roll those modifications back.

> **Tip: It's always a good idea to start with an empty revision! This allows
> you to roll all the way back while still holding onto your database. You can
> create this empty revision with `flask db revision -m'Create DB'`.**

If you want to seed your database, now would be a great time to write out your
`seed.py` script and run it to generate some test data. Faker has been included
in the Pipfile if you'd like to use that library.

#### `config.py`

When developing a large Python application, you might run into a common issue:
_circular imports_. A circular import occurs when two modules import from one
another, such as `app.py` and `models.py`. When you create a circular import and
attempt to run your app, you'll see the following error:

```console
ImportError: cannot import name
```

If you're going to need an object in multiple modules like `app` or `db`,
creating a _third_ module to instantiate these objects can save you a great deal
of circular grief. Here's a good start to a Flask config file (you may need more
if you intend to include features like authentication and passwords):

```py
# Standard library imports




## Updating Your README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that describes your project. These files can be
used in many different ways- you may have noticed that we use them to generate
entire Canvas lessons- but they're most commonly used as homepages for online
Git repositories. **When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this lesson's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a full-stack application, but it all relies on concepts
that you've practiced thoroughly throughout this phase. Hopefully this template
and guide will get you off to a good start with your Phase 4 Project.

Happy coding!
